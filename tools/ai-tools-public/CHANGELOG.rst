**0.2.0 - 08/06/26**

- **Breaking:** Remove ``/simsci:code-reviewer``. There is no longer a review-only entry point.
- Implement new ``/simsci:pr-prep`` skill which carries a change you have already written
  from review through fixes and triage to a PR.
- Extract ``framework-development``'s finish sequence to a new ``_finalize-core`` skill
  (which is now used by ``framework-development``, the new ``pr-prep`` skill, and
  ``simsci-internal``'s ``model-development``)

**0.1.0 - 07/27/26**

- Initial release: generic developer tooling extracted from the ``simsci-internal`` plugin (MIC-7220)
- Ships the multi-agent code review family (``/simsci:code-reviewer``), ``git-rescue``,
  ``commit-splitter``, ``type-hinter``, ``regression-debugger``, ``workflow-assessment``,
  ``change-propagation``, and ``framework-development``
