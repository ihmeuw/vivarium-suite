"""Modularized functions for building project data artifacts.

This module is an abstraction around the load portion of our artifact building ETL pipeline.
The intent is to be declarative so it's easy to see what is put into the artifact and how.
Some degree of verbosity/boilerplate is fine in the interest of transparancy.

.. admonition::

   Logging in this module should be done at the ``debug`` level.
